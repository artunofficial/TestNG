	//Polymorphism means Many Forms
	
	//Types of Polymorphism in Java
	
	//1. Method Overloading / CompileTime Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism / Static Binding 
	
	//How to achieve Method Overloading?
	//Criteria 1 - Method name should be the same
	//Criteria 2 - Should be in the same class
	//Criteria 3 - Parameters / Arguments should be different
	
	
	//2. Method Overriding / Dynamic Binding / RunTime Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism 
	
	//How to achieve Method Overriding ?
	//Criteria 1 - Method name should be the same
	//Criteria 2 - Class name will be different
	//Criteria 3 - Arguments will be the same
	//Criteria 4 - Inheritance has to be there

	//Method Overriding means Chil Class method is taking precedence over the Parent class method
	//Access modifier of overriden method in child class should be equivalent or higherthan the parent Class method
