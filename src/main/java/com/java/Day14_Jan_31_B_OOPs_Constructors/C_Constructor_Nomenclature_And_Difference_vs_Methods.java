	//Difference No 1 - Constructor has to have the ClassName, method can have any name
	//Difference No 2 - Methods have to have a return type, constructor has no return type not even void
	//Difference No 3 - Constructor cannot be declared static but methods can be declared as static
	//Difference No 4 - A constructor is invoked the moment an Object is created, that is not the case with methods
	//Difference No 5 - Constructors can only be overloaded, but not overridden whereas methods can do both
