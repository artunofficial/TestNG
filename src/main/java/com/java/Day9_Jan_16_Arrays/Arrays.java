		// Data Structure (memory storage) and Algorithms (but an intelligent logic)
		
		//Arrays - it is a very straight forward concept
		//Array is a data-structure/object that contains homogeneous[same data type] elements
		//length of the array is determined/decided the time of creation and once created it remains fixed
		//indexing position of an array starts from zero and if there are total n elements the last element 
		////will be inside (n-1)th position
		
		//there is a birth certificate - private
		
		//10, 20, 30 ... 100
		//element 10 is in 0th position
		//element 100 is in 9th position
		
		//Features of Arrays
		//1. Indexing position starts from 0
		//2. Any Java Array variable can be declared like other variables but the representational form is dimension 
		///which is []
		
		int a = 30; //here is simply a variable int datatype
		int b[] = {10,20,30}; //here b is an array variable of int type
		
		//3. All the variables in the array ordered
		//4. Since array are objects, they occupy memory space
		//5. Parent class of Array is Object Class
		//6. Arrays are alwaus created at Runtime
		//7. You want to determine the length of an array - YOu have to use a member known as LENGTH
		
		//Advantages of Array
		//1. Store multiple data items using a single name
		int c=10;
		int c1[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70};
		
		//2. We can access of any element of the array using the indexes
		//3. Arrays can be used to implement other data structures such as LinkedList, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, etc.
		//4. Primitive data types conversion to Wrapper Class Objects will not happen in case of arrays.  
		///Hence they are faster in operation
		
		//Disadvantages of Array
		//1. Fixed Size
		//2. Memory Wastage
		//3. Strongly typed - which is pre defined 
		//4. Arrays do not have any kind of add or remove methods
		
		//What kind of Arrays we should learn ?
		//1-D array
		//2-D array
		//3-D array
		//Jagged Array
		//Object Array
